# Program cracking: buffer overflow && patching

My comrade wrote a tiny programm [pass](pass) that asks for password. He added 2 non-patching vulnerabilities in this programm.

I found one (read as "left second one for you to have a fun") and created appropriate string to abuse it, check [overflow_buffer_abuser](print_ascii.cpp)

Also i patched it: [crack](crack.cpp)
